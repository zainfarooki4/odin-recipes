        <h3>Lasagna Recipe</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish that's loved worldwide for its comforting and hearty appeal. It's made by layering flat pasta sheets with a rich sauce, typically a meaty Bolognese sauce or a vegetarian alternative like marinara sauce. Between these layers of pasta and sauce, there's often a creamy blend of ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and sometimes Parmesan cheese, creating a decadent and flavorful filling. The dish is then baked until the pasta is tender and the cheeses are melted and golden brown on top, resulting in a deliciously satisfying meal.

            What sets lasagna apart is its versatility. While the classic version includes meat sauce and cheese, there are countless variations to suit different tastes and dietary preferences. From spinach and mushroom lasagna to seafood or even vegan versions with plant-based protein, lasagna can be customized in many ways, making it a beloved staple in home kitchens and restaurants alike.</p>

              <h3>Butter Chicken Recipe</h3>
              <p>To make butter chicken, start by marinating boneless chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, salt, and a blend of spices like garam masala, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes to overnight for the flavors to infuse.

                Next, heat butter in a pan and sauté onions until golden brown. Add tomato puree, cashew paste, and cream, then cook until the sauce thickens. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until tender and fully cooked. Finish with a dollop of butter and a sprinkle of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) for an authentic touch. Serve hot with naan or steamed rice for a delicious meal.</p>
